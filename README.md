✅ Kubernetes Installation – Pre-Requisites & Setup Plan
We are preparing to install Kubernetes using MobaXterm for terminal access. Below are the planned system configurations for both testing and production environments.

🧪 Testing Environment (For Basic Setup & Learning)
CPU: 2 vCores

RAM: 4 GB

Disk Volume: 16 GB

Purpose:

Test Kubernetes installation

Run basic pods and services

Validate cluster setup

⚠️ Note: Suitable for practice and basic use only. Not recommended for running real workloads.

🚀 Production Environment (Minimum Planned Setup)
CPU: 2 vCores

RAM: 4 GB

Disk Volume: 25–30 GB

Purpose:

Run Kubernetes with light workloads

Host sample applications and services in a controlled environment

⚠️ Recommendation: For stable production workloads, consider upgrading to at least 8 GB RAM and using multiple nodes (1 master + 2 workers).
